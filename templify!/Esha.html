                    Hello! My name is Esha Singh and I’m one of the founders of Templify! I’m currently a first year Computer Science major at the Georgia Institute of Technology. This project was definitely a reach for me since I started Templify during my first semester at Georgia Tech, in which I was taking an Intro to Python course. However, since the COVID-19 pandemic, I have found a new respect for small businesses and try my hardest everyday to support them as much as possible. Now, with Templify, I have a new way to support small businesses.  
                </p>
